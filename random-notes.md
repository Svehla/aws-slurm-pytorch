## `TS` vs `PY` vs `terraform` for infrastructure code

### Python props
- infra people are using python more than JS
- easy to setup and run
- jupyter notebook ecosystem
- i could extract cluster infra into docker image similar as miob did
- not switching language context between app code + infra code

### TS props
- type inference
- better parallel execution calls
- better deps checks
- better module file system
- better prettier + eslint tooling
